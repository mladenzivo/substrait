# User-Defined Functions

Substrait supports the creation of custom functions using [simple extensions](../extensions/index.md#simple-extensions), using the facilities described in [scalar functions](scalar_functions.md). In fact, the functions defined by Substrait use the same mechanism. The extension files for them can be found [here](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/tree/main/extensions).
